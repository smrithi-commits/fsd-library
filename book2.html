            <h3>About story</h3>
            <p>
              Orikkal" (ഒരിക്കൽ), by N. Mohanan, stands as a poignant and deeply
              introspective work within Malayalam literature. This novel,
              initially serialized as "Ragangalkku Oru Kaalam" in Malayala
              Manorama, transcends conventional romantic narratives, evolving
              into a profound exploration of human relationships, memory, and
              the lingering echoes of love. At its core, "Orikkal" is marked by
              its autobiographical undertones. N. Mohanan draws from his own
              life, particularly a significant romantic relationship, to craft a
              narrative that resonates with raw emotional honesty. This personal
              dimension imbues the story with a sense of authenticity, allowing
              readers to connect with the characters and their experiences on a
              deeply human level. The novel is characterized by its nuanced
              exploration of love, not as a fleeting emotion, but as a force
              that shapes and defines lives. It delves into the complexities of
              human connection, portraying the delicate interplay of emotions,
              desires, and vulnerabilities that characterize intimate
              relationships. The narrative captures the ephemeral nature of such
              connections, acknowledging the inevitability of loss and the
              enduring impact of cherished memories. N. Mohanan's writing style
              is a hallmark of "Orikkal." His prose is marked by its lyrical
              quality, evoking a sense of nostalgia and introspection. He
              employs evocative language and imagery to create a rich emotional
              landscape, allowing readers to immerse themselves in the
              characters' experiences. The narrative unfolds with a measured
              pace, allowing for moments of quiet reflection and emotional
              depth.
